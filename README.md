# Title: LeafletMapForANF
#
# Author: John H Doucette Jr
#
# Intro: This project was developed because of my enthusiasm for tinkering with the LeafletJS Engine.
# So my boss and I decided to flex my JS knowledge and learn more about map building to fill a need.
# This Project is done completely in vanilla Javascript with minimum of frame works addon's.
# 
# My style is that for complicated function each of the steps or process are broken into function expressions
# and then executed towards the end of the function as readable short text line calls to these expressions.
# Large scoped tasks or segments of code are placed into its own file for easier maintenence.
# NOTE: Async function were used sparingly only were it made sense or already existed, My style is more of a
        top down functional programmer.
        
# The two main files are "index.js" and "SupportFunctions.js" for the map startup they are
# under the "Modules" folder.
